    DOGKEY is an IoT smart home app that protects the dog's physical and mental health when the owner is not at home. 
overview: |
    Since Covid-19, more and more high-income young people are opting for a dog as an alternative to their lives, and they regard the dog as part of the family. So when the dog is alone at home, they worry about the dog's emotions, want to know what the dog is doing at home, and want to keep abreast of the dog's physical condition.<br/> 
    So DOGKEY is here. It can make real-time video calls and interactions, identify the dog activities and give early warnings, feed the dog intelligently and scientifically, monitor the dog's physical indicators, and provide suggestions for improvement.

    Nowadays, the Chinese pet market size is rapidly expanding.
    Especially since covid-19, pets have been regarded as a kind of spiritual companion, 
    so more and more Chinese families choose to keep pets. 

    Most Chinese pet owners are between the age of 25-40 and located in first and second-tier cities.
    They tend to have higher incomes (66% of those with a monthly salary of more than 8,000 yuan) 
    and better educational degrees (65.2% of those with college and master's degrees).


refection: |
    Starting from the identity of a pet owner, I started this UXD journey step by step, 
    inspired by the problems I encountered in raising dogs. My most significant learning 
    from this project was creating a product from 0 to 1: from conducting user research 
    to defining design requirements and developing prototypes. I learned the importance 
    of capturing research data and understood how different the insights from it could be 
    from user interviews. It's all about using the right method for a problem! 
    <br/>
    If I have more time, I'd like to be able to conduct user testing and commercial 
    viability investigations, and I'd like to know how easy it is 
    to implement these product features on a technical level.

  Feature 1 # Pain Point 1
  not enough time with their dog

  Real-time Interaction


  Real-time monitoring of dog activities: The app will immediately notify the pet owner to check if abnormal behavior is found.

  Dog owners can make video calls with their dogs anytime, anywhere, and at the same time, add filters and special effects to make video calls full of fun.

  The recording video function supports online editing and one-click upload to my profile so you can revisit these memories forever.

  Does the dog have too much energy to release? The play function supports pet owners in remotely choosing toys to play with their dogs to relieve their anxiety and depression when alone.
