  A mobile app designed for people with food intolerances to rediscover delicious recipes and the relationship between food and the body.
overview: |
    
    The food we eat can affect our health and mood, especially for people with food intolerances. However, many people are unaware of their sensitivity toward specific food and continue eating it, which can subtly affect gut health and cause chronic inflammation, eventually developing into chronic diseases. So I designed the DietWell app to help people identify food intolerances and recommend recipes for those with food sensitivities. People can also join communities on different topics to discuss diet and health issues.

  My most significant learning from this project was user research and identified needs. Although it is difficult at the beginning, the answer is evident after doing it step by step. Each function is not imagined out of thin air but based on the previous actions, so it is logical. At the same time, I am a designer, not an artist, and I realize that I need to focus on users' needs and design good products for them instead of my thoughts.

  The next consideration is how to improve the enthusiasm and quality of creators. The platform may invite some well-known nutritionists to settle in and reward excellent creators who post. At the same time, how to market and monetize the function of food journaling is also a point worth considering, which requires technical investment.
