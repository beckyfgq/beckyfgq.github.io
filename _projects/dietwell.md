  A mobile app designed for people with food intolerances to rediscover delicious recipes and the relationship between food and the body.
overview: |
    
    The food we eat can affect our health and mood, especially for people with food intolerances. However, many people are unaware of their sensitivity toward specific food and continue eating it, which can subtly affect gut health and cause chronic inflammation, eventually developing into chronic diseases. So I designed the <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">DietWell</strong> app to help people <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">identify food intolerances</strong> and <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">recommend recipes</strong> for those with food sensitivities. People can also <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">join communities</strong> on different topics to discuss diet and health issues.

    Although food allergies are uncommon, food intolerances affect most people <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">worldwide</strong>.
    <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">Identifying</strong> food intolerances early in life can help us <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">prevent serious health problems</strong> like autoimmune diseases from developing. 
    The <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">earlier</strong> we <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">eliminate</strong> foods we are intolerant to, the <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">better</strong> our quality of life will be for extended periods.

  My most significant learning from this project was <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">user research</strong> and <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">identified needs</strong>. Although it is difficult at the beginning, the answer is evident after doing it step by step. Each function is not imagined out of thin air but based on the previous actions, so it is <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">logical</strong>. At the same time, I am a <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">designer</strong>, not an artist, and I realize that I need to focus on <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">users' needs</strong> and design good products for them instead of my thoughts.

  The next consideration is how to improve the <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">enthusiasm</strong> and <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">quality</strong> of creators. The platform may invite some well-known <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">nutritionists</strong> to settle in and <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">reward</strong> excellent creators who post. At the same time, how to <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">market</strong> and <strong style="color:#4ad4a2;">monetize</strong> the function of food journaling is also a point worth considering, which requires technical investment.
